## 10/13/2025 10 AM - Begun Design of key layout  

* Begun keyboard definition in ergogen
* read through FlatFootFox's "Lets Design a Keyboard" introduction and 1/4 of part 1 ( https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-part1-units-points/ )
* Did research on implementing rotary encoder and/or sliding potentiometer into keyboard design; rotary encoder is feasable, sliding potentiometer is not

## 10/13/2025 5 PM - Designed keymap

- Defined all the keys in ergogen
- came up with a 40 key layout (6x3 main body 1x2 thumbfan)
- Designed the keymap utilizing home-row-mods and special layers configurable in zmk. 
- I am planning on implementing Hyprland specific keybinds to the keymap to let me navigate my window manager faster

next steps:
- design key layout in ergogen for ergonomics
- brainstorm case designs  

## 10/15/2025 - Designed key layout  

- took measurements of my hands
- did research on how to use said measurements in keyboard layout
- made the keyboard layout using ergogen
- spent a while (not included in time estimate, it was like 30 minutes tho) configuring the GODDAMN PRINTER
- verified that there was no overlap between keys which is a bit harder (not much) than it sounds due to how ergogen renders keys

- printed out a couple tests for the key layout to make sure it felt good to type on

- figured out how to push to github so now you can see my code on github (also not included in time estimate, it was like 30 minutes also, github CLI hates me)
  

## 10/16/2025 12 AM - Begun design of pcb  

- did research on part pricing
- started budgeting my build and researching keycaps, switches, encoders etc
- begun design and layout of pcb
- decided on a wired split design using a TRRS cable to communicate between each side
- have ideas for a case (wrist rest mayhaps)
- FlatFootFoxes guide, which i have been using to learn how to use Ergogen, is not of as much help now due to how our designs diverge.

## 10/16/2025 10 PM - Preparations for fabrication  

- finalized keyboard design (not including case and other stuff, just the pcb and components that go on said pcb)
- finished wiring up left side of keyboard
- begun making the schematic because ergogen only outputs the pcb file and blueprint needs pcb and schematic file for submission.

## 10/18/2025 - SO turns out i cant fully use ergogen  

- uhh, so the docs/faq didnt mention ergogen, turns out the ones on slack are different
- uhhh, so we can use ergogen to design keyboard layout but not pcb
- so i made the schematic from scratch and now im going to do the pcb
- at least it makes designing pcb/schematic/case easier pretty much

## 10/19/2025 - More PCB shenanigans  

- placed the pcb components and lined them up with the layout I laid out in ergogen
- routed the traces, spent like 5 minutes finding the last trace
- the 3d models are all messed up and something is messed up with everything
- idek how to explain it
- everything is on the wrong side of the pcb somehow

- to do 
	- fix pcb
	- make right side of pcb
	- prepare for fabrication
