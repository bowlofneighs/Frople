## 10/13/2025 10 AM - Begun Design of key layout  

* Begun keyboard definition in ergogen
* read through FlatFootFox's "Lets Design a Keyboard" introduction and 1/4 of part 1 ( https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-part1-units-points/ )
* Did research on implementing rotary encoder and/or sliding potentiometer into keyboard design; rotary encoder is feasable, sliding potentiometer is not

- Defined all the keys in ergogen
- came up with a 40 key layout (6x3 main body 1x2 thumbfan)
- Designed the keymap utilizing home-row-mods and special layers configurable in zmk. 
- I am planning on implementing Hyprland specific keybinds to the keymap to let me navigate my window manager faster

next steps:
- design key layout in ergogen for ergonomics
- brainstorm case designs
