# Frople
Frople is a split ergonomic keyboard with a 40 key layout. It utilizes a 6x3 main matrix and a 2x1 thumbfan on each side. It uses 2 Arduino Pro Micros as its MCUs and QMK for the firmware. The keys were designed specifically with my hand dimensions in mind, seeing as I took measurements of my finger-length to decide the key stagger. It will take advantage of home-row-mods to allow me to still use my mod keys with such a small key footprint. It also has extra layers to account for the keys that could not fit on the main layer. It uses a TRS cable to communicate between the two halves of the keyboard using serial communcation. In the future it could theoretically be upgraded with a Nice!Nano V2 to allow for wireless communication between the two halves and the computer through BLE (bluetooth low energy). However my current computer does not have bluetooth and the Nice!Nano V2 was more expensive than the Arduino Pro Micro and as such I went with the Pro Micro for the MCU.
